# Attestia Desktop

> Financial intent verification for Windows — WinUI 3 app and .NET SDK for blockchain attestation and reconciliation

## Overview

Attestia Desktop verifies financial intent before it hits the chain. Instead of auditing after the fact, transactions are approved structurally — with typed intents, cryptographic proofs, and deterministic reconciliation. This repo contains the WinUI 3 desktop app and three standalone .NET libraries.

## Quick Start

```
git clone https://github.com/mcp-tool-shop-org/Attestia-Desktop.git
cd Attestia-Desktop
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet test
```

Prerequisites: .NET 9.0 SDK, Node.js 20+ (for the Attestia backend), Windows 10 1809+.

## NuGet Packages

- `Attestia.Core` — Domain models, enums, shared types for intent verification and attestation
- `Attestia.Client` — HTTP client SDK with typed clients for Intents, Proofs, Reconciliation, Compliance, Events
- `Attestia.Sidecar` — Node.js sidecar process management (spawn, health checks, auto-restart, graceful shutdown)

## API Entry Points

```csharp
// Verify an intent
using Attestia.Client;
var client = new AttestiaClient(options);
var result = await client.Intents.VerifyAsync(intent);

// Manage the Node.js backend
using Attestia.Sidecar;
await using var sidecar = new SidecarProcess(options);
await sidecar.StartAsync();
```

## Architecture

```
Attestia.App (WinUI 3)    → UI layer
Attestia.Client            → HTTP SDK with typed API clients
Attestia.Core              → Domain models, enums, shared types
Attestia.Sidecar           → Node.js backend lifecycle management
```

## Constraints

- Windows only (WinUI 3)
- Requires .NET 9.0 and Node.js 20+
- The Attestia TypeScript backend must be running (managed by Sidecar or manually)
- Intent verification is structural, not heuristic — all transitions are typed
