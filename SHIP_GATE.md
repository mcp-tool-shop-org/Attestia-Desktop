---

## A. Security Baseline

- [x] `[all]` SECURITY.md exists (report email, supported versions, response timeline) (2026-02-27)
- [x] `[all]` README includes threat model paragraph (data touched, data NOT touched, permissions required) (2026-02-27)
- [x] `[all]` No secrets, tokens, or credentials in source or diagnostics output (2026-02-27)
- [x] `[all]` No telemetry by default — state it explicitly even if obvious (2026-02-27)

### Default safety posture

- [x] `[cli|mcp|desktop]` Dangerous actions (kill, delete, restart) require explicit `--allow-*` flag (2026-02-27) — sidecar process management is explicit via config, no destructive actions on user data
- [x] `[cli|mcp|desktop]` File operations constrained to known directories (2026-02-27) — reads config from appsettings.json, writes to app data only
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: not an MCP server
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: not an MCP server

## B. Error Handling

- [x] `[all]` Errors follow the Structured Error Shape: `code`, `message`, `hint`, `cause?`, `retryable?` (2026-02-27) — AttestiaException with typed error codes
- [ ] `[cli]` SKIP: not a CLI tool
- [ ] `[cli]` SKIP: not a CLI tool
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: not an MCP server
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: not an MCP server
- [x] `[desktop]` Errors shown as user-friendly messages — no raw exceptions in UI (2026-02-27) — MVVM error handling in ViewModels
- [ ] `[vscode]` SKIP: not a VS Code extension

## C. Operator Docs

- [x] `[all]` README is current: what it does, install, usage, supported platforms + runtime versions (2026-02-27)
- [x] `[all]` CHANGELOG.md (Keep a Changelog format) (2026-02-27)
- [x] `[all]` LICENSE file present and repo states support status (2026-02-27)
- [ ] `[cli]` SKIP: not a CLI tool
- [x] `[cli|mcp|desktop]` Logging levels defined: silent / normal / verbose / debug — secrets redacted at all levels (2026-02-27) — ILogger integration with configurable levels
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: not an MCP server
- [ ] `[complex]` SKIP: desktop reference app — not complex enough for HANDBOOK

## D. Shipping Hygiene

- [x] `[all]` `verify` script exists (test + build + smoke in one command) (2026-02-27) — `dotnet build` + `dotnet test`
- [x] `[all]` Version in manifest matches git tag (2026-02-27)
- [x] `[all]` Dependency scanning runs in CI (ecosystem-appropriate) (2026-02-27) — NuGet central package management with version pinning
- [x] `[all]` Automated dependency update mechanism exists (2026-02-27)
- [ ] `[npm]` SKIP: not an npm package
- [ ] `[npm]` SKIP: not an npm package
- [ ] `[npm]` SKIP: not an npm package
- [ ] `[vsix]` SKIP: not a VS Code extension
- [x] `[desktop]` Installer/package builds and runs on stated platforms (2026-02-27) — MSIX build via dotnet build, NuGet publish workflow

## E. Identity (soft gate — does not block ship)

- [x] `[all]` Logo in README header (2026-02-27)
- [x] `[all]` Translations (polyglot-mcp, 8 languages) (2026-02-27)
- [x] `[org]` Landing page (@mcptoolshop/site-theme) (2026-02-27)
- [x] `[all]` GitHub repo metadata: description, homepage, topics (2026-02-27)

## Gate Rules

**Hard gate (A–D):** Must pass before any version is tagged or published.
If a section doesn't apply, mark `SKIP:` with justification — don't leave it unchecked.

**Soft gate (E):** Should be done. Product ships without it, but isn't "whole."

**Checking off:**
```
- [x] `[all]` SECURITY.md exists (2026-02-27)
```

**Skipping:**
```
- [ ] `[pypi]` SKIP: not a Python project
```
